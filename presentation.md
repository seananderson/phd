# Introduction

*quote slide*  
"Population ecology is about understanding fluctuations in numbers over time and space." -Koenig 1999 TREE

*sheep in scotland slide*  
these feral sheep populations on two separate islands in Scotland have synchronized boom and bust cycles. Why?

*salmon slide*  
Chinook populations in Alaska are on average XX times less variable than populations in Sacramento ... why?

*?? schindler paper? or from Moore et al. Ecology?*  
And this fishery is X times less likely to have a 'bad' year than this fishery. Why?

*understanding and decision making slide*  
These questions are important to our understanding of how the ecological world works, but also to making better decisions for local resource management, and to guiding large-scale policy decisions.

*jelly beans*  
One realization that developed over the last 50 years or so is that there may be a link between how diverse a system is and how stable it is.

This might be, for example, species diversity, or genetic diversity, or the diversity of how organisms respond to the environment.

And it might be measured within a single area or community, or across multiple communities, or as the variety in diversity across communities, or any number of ways.

Through all of this, it starts to become apparent that the question of what makes systems more or less variable is not a simple one and can be asked at many different scales and from many different angles.

*silhouette graphics of different coloured dots, thermometer, lots of people*  
But it's an important question. Diversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate and is very slow to recover. Climate change is inducing conditions that are challenging the ability for many species to adapt. And human population is growing and making it increasingly imperative that we manage our oceans and land in a way ...

*tools slide*  
So, we need tools to quantifying the benefits of various kinds of diversity.
We need ways of communicating the benefits of diversity.
And we need ways of making good decisions about how we allocate conservation effort to limit risk in the face of uncertainty about future environmental conditions.

The ecological portfolio concept is one tool that's ideally suited to this.

*slide with $ symbols, separate at top, pool together at bottom, diffent colours*

Here's the idea:

In finance, a portfolio is simply a collection of 'things' we invest in. 

In its traditional sense, it might be a set of stocks (or *assets*) that you invest in on the stock market. You could put all your money in one stock, but we all know that's a bad idea. That one stock might do very badly, and it's likely much more variable from day to day and year to year than the market as a whole.

And so we 'diversify our investments'. We don't put all our eggs in one basket. 

We put some of our money into bank companies, and some of our money into technology companies, some in Canadian markets, and some in markets from other countries, some in high risk companies, and some in low-risk government bonds. And in doing so, we can reduce the risk that we'll lose a lot of money at any one time without changing the average or 'expected' long-term earnings of our portfolio. 

There's a ton of research in finance to how we should best spread out our money. The idea is maybe we can take some of that knowledge and apply it to ecological systems.

An ecological portfolio can be many things, but at its core the analogy goes something like this:

*slide: finance -> ecology; reveal each*

- Instead of financial stocks or assets we have *species* or *populations*.
- Instead of a financial portfolio we have a *community*, *metapopulation*, or *ecosystem*.
- Instead of sector or geographic diversity of stocks, we have diversity of ....
- Instead of market conditions, we have things like environmental conditions...
- Instead of portfolio managers, we have resource managers

This idea has been explored in the ecology literature for about 15 years now. But it's really exploded in the last 5 or so and I think it has tremendous potential to help us re-examine what reduces variability and risk in population dynamics, make better decisions about how to manage ecological resources, and convey often abstract concepts of diversity and stability to the general public.

In my thesis I: 

*Measuring portfolio effects (Ch. 1) (Anderson et al. 2013, Methods Ecol. Evol.)*   Examine how we measure how much better ecological systems are by acting as diversity portfolios

*Portfolio conservation (Ch. 2) (Anderson et al. In press. Ecol. Appl.)*  
Ask how we can manage salmon metapopulation portfolios to...

*Black swan dynamics (Ch. 3)*  
Ask how the concept of extreme risk, or black swans, from financial portfolios applies to ecological populations.

--------------------

 variability and risk... and yet we're losing all sorts of diversity in ecological populations around the world...

Why are some populations more variable than others?

Is the loss of 'diversity' a problem?

Loss of biodiversity a big problem and frequently focussed on

But diversity is about more than just species counts, show QVD

We need ways of quantifying the benefits of various kinds of diversity (give examples).
Ways of communicating the benefits of diversity.
Ways of making good decisions about how we allocate conservation effort to limit risk in the face of uncertainty

Ecological portfolio concept is one tool that's ideally suited to this

Go into the analogy:

- what is a portfolio?
- what is portfolio diversification?
- how does this relate to ecology?

An extension to thinking about financial portfolios and risk is thinking about extreme risk... what happens when things are really really bad?

Compound that with climate change, climate variability, and climate extremes in fact, we've seen a movement toward this...

And so this brings me to my 3 chapters


- species loss is a large and growing problem
- but biodiversity is about more than just species counts
- Georgina Mace describes: we can assess biodiversity at all sorts of levels, and these levels can be important in more than just their quantity; also their variability and distribution
- give, say, 2 examples
- these levels too, 
- exacerbated by factors such as shifting means in climate 


- move the temperature slide here?

Effective ecological decision making requires approaches to assessing, managing, and communicating ecological variance and risk.

This is a bigger problem now than ever before and is only increasing in importance.

we need ways forward
- we need ways of quantifying the benefits of various kinds of diversity (give examples)
- we need ways of communicating the benefits of diversity to the public and decision makers
- we need ways of making good decisions about how we allocate conservation effort to limit risk in the face of uncertainty

give some examples of where we've seen this

"One of the most ubiquitous phenomena of all natural populations is their variability in numbers in space and time. However, there are notable differences among populations in the way the population size fluctuates." -Lunderberg et al.
