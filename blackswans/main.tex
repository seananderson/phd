\section{Abstract}

Black swans are statistically improbable events that nonetheless occur---often
with profound consequences. While extremes in the physical environment, such
as monsoons and heat waves, are widely studied and increasing in magnitude and
frequency, it remains unclear the extent to which ecological populations
buffer or suffer from such extremes. Here, we develop a probability model to
estimate the degree of heavy-tailedness (presence of black swans) in
ecological process noise. We apply our model to \NPops~time series from around
the world across \NOrders~taxonomic orders and seven classes. We find strong
evidence of black swans, but they are rare, occurring in
\overallMinPerc--\overallMaxPerc\% of populations: most frequently for birds
(\AvesRangePerc\%) followed by mammals (\MammaliaRangePerc\%), and insects
(\InsectaRangePerc\%). Black swans were predominantly (\percBSDown \%)
downward events and were not explained by any life-history covariates, but
tended to be driven by external perturbations such as climate, severe winters,
predator or parasite cycles, and the combined effects of multiple factors.
Extreme events were more frequently detected for populations with longer time
series and lower levels of process noise; for shorter and noisier time series,
our simulations suggested black-swan dynamics are often not identifiable as
such. The presence of black swans in population dynamics highlights the
importance of developing robust conservation and management
strategies---particularly as the frequency and magnitude of climate extremes
increase over the next century.

\section{Introduction}

Black swans are unexpected extreme events with potentially dramatic
consequences \citep{taleb2007,sornette2009}. One of the most striking black
swans in ecology is the possible asteroid collision marking the end-Cretaceous
mass extinction 65 million years ago \citep{alvarez1980,harnik2012}. Today,
climate extremes, in concert with shifts in mean temperature, are expected to
cause the greatest ecological and societal damage \citep{ipcc2012}. But, while
extremes in the physical environment such as wave height, storm severity, and
temperature are frequent events \citep{gaines1993,katz2005}, it remains
unclear the extent to which ecological systems buffer or suffer from black
swans \citep{nunez2012}.

There is compelling anecdotal evidence for ecological black swans, but
systematic evidence across taxa has been elusive. A survey of ecologists
indicated that surprising outcomes of field experiments are far more common
than we assume \citep{doak2008}, and events such as the global invasion of
Argentine ants and the mutation of viruses to infect new hosts could be
considered black swans \citep{nunez2012}. In fact, anecdotes of population
catastrophes are numerous and catastrophes may be the most important element
affecting population persistence \citep{mangel1994}. For marine mammal
populations, we have compelling evidence of catastrophes \citep{gerber2001,
  ward2007}, and recently, time-series of marine microbe abundance
\citep{segura2013} and time to extinction for experimental waterflea
populations \citep{drake2014} have been found to have heavier tailed
distributions than the normal. Despite these anecdotes, as far as we can tell
there have been two systematic surveys for ecological black swans: one with
North American breeding birds and the other with the Global Population
Dynamics Database, which uncovered little clear evidence for them
\citep{keitt1998,allen2001,halley2002}. Nevertheless there are methodological
challenges to their detection \citep{allen2001,ward2007}.

There are two key reasons why we may find little evidence of ecological black
swans. First, they might not exist in higher taxa. Indeed, the majority of
model fitting and risk forecasting assumes that population dynamics are not
heavy tailed \citep[e.g.][]{brook2006a,dennis2006,knape2012}. Alternatively,
heavy-tailed dynamics might exist, but our ability to detect them requires
further development of statistical tools. One such tool is the generalized
extreme value distribution, which has been applied to environmental data
\citep[e.g.][]{katz2005}. This distribution describes the most extreme event
per time interval (e.g.~heaviest rainfall per year), but requires time series
that are sufficiently long to be condensed into time intervals. Another
statistical tool involves fitting a catastrophic mixture distribution in a
state space model to quantify the probability that population events are
extreme, although this is also data intensive \citep{ward2007}. A third tool is
to compare the support for fits of thin- and heavy-tailed distributions
\citep{halley2002}, but this analysis did not quantify the probability of black
swans or allow for population dynamics.


%TODO: this paragraph is written as if geared towards a methods journal. I suggest starting with a statement of general aim rather than method.
Here we develop a framework for identifying ecological black swans in the
process noise of population dynamics, i.e.\ the stochastic jumps in abundance
from one time step to the next. Our framework quantifies both the magnitude and
probability of heavy-tailed dynamics, allows for a range of population dynamic
models, can incorporate observation uncertainty, and can be easily applied to
abundance time series. We apply our model to \NPops\ populations and estimate
the frequency and strength of black-swan events in population dynamics across
taxonomy; verify some causes of black-swan events; and attempt to identify
characteristics of time series or intrinsic life-history characteristics that
are associated with heavy-tailed dynamics.

\section{Methods}

To obtain estimates of the probability and magnitude of black-swan events, we
fit population dynamic models to abundance time series from around the world.
For each population, we estimated the shape of the process noise tails by
measuring the degrees of freedom ($\nu$) of a Student t-distribution.

\subsection{Time-series data}

We selected abundance time series from the Global Population Dynamics Database
(GPDD; \citeauthor{gpdd2010} \citeyear{gpdd2010}), which contains nearly 5000
time series of abundance from $\sim$1000 species and $\sim$100 taxonomic
orders. We filtered the data (Supporting Information) to remove populations
from less reliable data sources, and those without sufficient data for our
models, and then interpolated some missing values
\citep[\textit{sensu}][]{brook2006a}. Our interpolation affected only
$\sim$\interpPointsPerc \% of the final data points (Table~\ref{tab:stats})
and none of the data points that were later considered black-swan events. Our
final dataset contained \NPops~populations across \NOrders~taxonomic orders
and seven taxonomic classes, with a median of \medianTimeSteps~time steps
(range of \minTimeSteps--\maxTimeSteps) (Table~\ref{tab:stats},
Fig.~\ref{fig:all-ts}).

\subsection{Population models}

Our main analysis focuses on the commonly applied Gompertz population dynamics
model \citep[e.g.][]{knape2012,dennis2014,connors2014}. The Gompertz model
represents population growth as a linear function in $\log$ space. If we let
$x_t$ represent the $\log$ abundance ($N$) at time $t$, we can represent the
Gompertz model as:
\begin{align*}
x_t &= \lambda + b x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\\
\epsilon_t &\sim \mathrm{Student\mhyphen t}(\nu, 0, \sigma).
\end{align*}
The growth parameter $\lambda$ represents the expected growth rate if $N_t =
1$. The model is density independent if $b = 1$, maximally density dependent if
$b = 0$, and inversely density dependent if $b < 0$. Usually, the process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is modelled as normally distributed, but in our paper we assume it
is drawn from a t distribution with scale parameter $\sigma$ and degrees of
freedom $\nu$. In previous analyses of the GPDD, the Gompertz was most often
identified as the most parsimonious population model that can be fit to these
data \citep{brook2006}.

By allowing the process noise to be drawn from a Student-t distribution we can
estimate the degree to which the process deviations have heavy tails and are
thereof evidence of black-swan events (Fig.~\ref{fig:didactic}a, b). For
example, at $\nu = 3$, the probability of drawing a value more than five
standard deviations below the mean is $0.02$, whereas the probability of
drawing such a value from a normal distribution is tiny ($2.9\cdot10^{-7}$). As
the value of $\nu$ approaches infinity, the distribution approaches the normal
distribution (Fig.~\ref{fig:didactic}a, b).

We fit all models in a Bayesian framework using Stan \citep{stan-manual2014}
via the R computing environment \citep{r2014}. Stan samples from the posterior
distribution with an adaptive version of Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo
called the No-U-Turn Sampler and generally obtains less correlated samples
than algorithms such as the Gibbs sampler \citep{hoffman2014}. We tested to
ensure that the chains had sufficiently converged and that the sampler had
obtained sufficient independent samples from the posterior ($\widehat{R} <
1.05$, $n_\mathrm{eff} > 200$; Supporting Information).

We chose weakly informative priors to incorporate our understanding of
plausible population dynamics (\citeauthor{gelman2014} \citeyear{gelman2014};
Figs~\ref{fig:didactic}f--h, \ref{fig:priors}). For $\nu$, we chose an
exponential prior with rate parameter of $0.01$ truncated at values above
two---a slightly less informative prior than suggested by
\citet{fernandez1998}. This prior gives only a \basePriorProbHeavy \%
probability that $\nu < 10$ but constrains the sampling sufficiently to avoid
wandering off towards infinity. In any case, for $\nu > 20$ the t distribution
is almost indistinguishable from the normal distribution
(Fig.~\ref{fig:didactic}). We investigated the sensitivity of our results to
weaker and stronger priors (exponential rate parameter $= 0.005, 0.02$;
Fig.~\ref{fig:priors}, Supporting Information). We used simulated data to test
how easily we could detect $\nu$ given different sample sizes and to ensure we
could recover unbiased parameter estimates from the Gompertz model (Supporting
Information).

We fit alternative population models to test if four key phenomena
systematically changed our conclusions. Autocorrelation has been suggested as
a reason for increased observed variability of abundance time series through
time, which could create apparent heavy tails \citep{inchausti2002};
therefore, we fit a model that included serial correlation in the residuals.
Additionally, previous work has modelled abundance or growth rates without
accounting for density dependence \citep{halley2002,segura2013}; therefore, we
fit a simpler model in which we assumed density independence. Third,
observation error could bias parameter estimates \citep{knape2012} or mask our
ability to detect heavy tails \citep{ward2007}; therefore, we fit a model
where we allowed for a fixed quantity of observation error ($0.2$ standard
deviations on a log scale). Finally, the Gompertz model assumes that
population growth rate declines linearly with log abundance. We also fit an
alternative model, the Ricker-logistic model, which assumes that population
growth rate declines linearly with abundance itself (Supporting Information).

\subsection{Covariates of population dynamic black swans}

We investigated possible covariates of heavy-tailed population dynamics
visually and through multilevel modelling. We plotted characteristics of the
time series ($\sigma$, $\lambda$, $b$, and time-series length) along with two
life-history characteristics (body length and maximum lifespan obtained from
\citet{brook2006a}) against our estimated probability of heavy tails, Pr$(\nu <
10)$. We formally investigated these relationships by fitting beta
regression multilevel models \citep{ferrari2004}. Beta regression is useful
for continuous response data that range between zero and one (e.g.\
probabilities); we fit our models with a logit link as is common for logistic
regression \citep{ferrari2004}. We incorporated standard deviations around the
means for covariates that were derived from Gompertz model parameter
estimates. To account for broad patterns of phylogenetic relatedness, we
allowed for hierarchical intercepts at the taxonomic class, order, and species
level (Supporting Information). We fit our model in Stan with weakly
informative priors on the coefficients \citep{gelman2008d} and variance
parameters (\citeauthor{gelman2006c} \citeyear{gelman2006c}
\citeauthor{gelman2014} \citeyear{gelman2014}; Supporting Information).

Finally, we investigated a sample of populations that our method categorized as
having a high probability of heavy tails (Pr$(\nu < 10) > 0.5$). Where
possible, we found the documented causes of ecological black swans in the
primary data source cited in the GPDD or in other literature describing the
population.

\section{Results}

%TODO: where did this threshold come from?  (nu < 10)
We found strong, but rare, evidence for black-swan population dynamics. By
defining black-swan dynamics as a greater than $0.5$ probability that $\nu <
10$, our main Gompertz model found evidence for heavy tails most frequently
for birds (\birdPH\%) followed by mammals (\mammalsPH\%), and insects
(\insectsPH\%) (Fig.~\ref{fig:nu-coefs}, Table~\ref{tab:causes-supp}). Black
swans were taxonomically widespread, occurring in \POrdersHeavy\% of taxonomic
orders. Accounting for time series length and partially pooling inference
across taxonomic class and order with a multilevel model, there was stronger
evidence for black swans in insect populations than is visually apparent in
Fig.~\ref{fig:nu-coefs}---four of 10 orders with the highest median
probability of heavy tails were insect orders---however, there was
considerable uncertainty in these estimates (Fig.~\ref{fig:posteriors}a).
%TODO: these multilevel modelling results (and fig 3, 4) are out of order

The majority of our heavy-tailed estimates were robust to alternative
population models, observation error, and choice of priors. Our conclusions
were not systematically altered when we included an autocorrelation structure
in the residuals, modelled population growth rates without density dependence,
or modelled the population dynamics as Ricker-logistic (Fig.~\ref{fig:alt}).
However, setting observation error standard deviation to $0.2$ increased the
median estimate of $\nu$ from $<10$ to $\ge 10$ in $\baseNuTenObsTenSwitch$ of
$\baseNuTen$ populations, although the majority of $\nu$ estimates remained
qualitatively similar (Fig.~\ref{fig:alt}). The strength of the prior on $\nu$
had little influence on estimates of black-swan dynamics
(Fig.~\ref{fig:alt-priors}). Our simulation testing shows that, if anything,
our models underpredict the true magnitude and probability of heavy tailed
events---especially given the length of the time series in the GPDD
(Figs~\ref{fig:sim-nu}, \ref{fig:sim-prob}).

Across populations, the probability of observing black-swan dynamics was
positively related to time-series length and negatively related to magnitude of
process noise ($\sigma$) but not clearly related to population growth rate
($\lambda$), density dependence ($b$), or maximum lifespan
(Figs~\ref{fig:correlates}, \ref{fig:posteriors}b). Longer time-series length
was the strongest covariate of observing black-swan dynamics. For instance, we
were about \pIncHeavyNThirtyNSixty~times as likely to observe heavy tails in a
population with 60 time steps compared to one with 30 time steps. However, the
absolute change in probability with increased time series length was small
($\pHeavyNSixty$ vs.\ $\pHeavyNThirty$ in the previous example,
Fig.~\ref{fig:correlates}).

We examined all time series with published explanations of why the black-swan
events occurred (Tables~\ref{tab:sparks} and \ref{tab:causes-supp}). The
majority (\percBSDown \%) of documented events were downward black swans and

involved a series of unfortunate events. For example, a shortage of nest sites

United Kingdom reduced population productivity and made the population more
vulnerable when a red tide hit in 1968 \citep{potts1980}. The population
experienced a black-swan downswing, but the new availability of nest sites
resulted in a rapid population upswing \citep{potts1980}. As another example,

an interaction between environmental- and predation-mediated population cycles
are thought to have caused a downward black-swan event for a water vole
(\textit{Arvicola terrestris}) population \citep{saucy1994}. Other black swans
were the result of a sequence of extreme climate events on their own. For
instance, severe winters in 1929, 1940--1942, and 1962--1963 were associated
with black-swan downswings in grey heron (\textit{Ardea cinerea}) abundance in
the United Kingdom \citep{stafford1971}. Our analysis finds that the last event
was a combination of two black-swan events in a row and it took the population
three times longer to recover than predicted \citep{stafford1971}.

\section{Discussion}

We found strong evidence for black swans (heavy-tailed process noise) in 3--5\%

of ecological time series. Black swans were usually downward events and were
detected more frequently in longer time series and in populations with a
smaller magnitude of process noise. Black swans were not associated with
density dependence, population growth rate, or lifespan. In verified cases,
% TODO 'interaction' word
black-swan events were often a result of the interaction between elements of
extreme climate, predators and parasite cycles, and strong changes in human
pressures. Our empirical results, sensitivity analyses, and simulation tests
suggest that estimating the tail shape of process noise is a viable method of
detecting black-swan population dynamics and if anything will underestimate the
probability of black-swan events. The presence of black swans highlights the
importance of developing management strategies that detect quickly, respond to,
and are robust to extremes in population dynamics---particularly as the
frequency and magnitude of climatic extremes increase over the next century
\citep{easterling2000,ipcc2012}.

Our results clarify previous related analyses. An analysis with an older
version of the GPDD assessed the distribution of abundance time series but
focused on identifying if the log-normal distribution was the most frequently
parsimonious model \citep{halley2002}. For heavy-tailed distributions,
\citet{halley2002} fit the extremely heavy-tailed Cauchy distribution and the
four-parameter Levy stable distribution and found little information criteria
support for these distributions in longer time series. However, black-swan
events are by definition rare, and the majority of time series in the GPDD are
short for these purposes. Therefore, we would not expect to observe black
swans in a large proportion of populations. By quantifying the probability of
heavy-tails and allowing for non-stationary time series and density
dependence, our analysis allows for a more nuanced description of the evidence
of ecological black swans. In an earlier study, \citet{keitt1998} described
heavy (power law) tails in breeding bird population abundance. However, this
finding was challenged by \citet{allen2001}, who showed that mixing data
across species could falsely generate heavy tails.
%This rebuttal supports our
%use of the t distribution to represent heavy tails, since a t distribution can
%be represented by a mixture of normal distributions \citep[with the same mean
%and inverse-gamma-distributed variances,][]{gelman2014}.

We might expect to observe black-swan dynamics in ecological time series
because of unmodelled intrinsic properties of populations or extrinsic forces
acting on populations. Since a t-distribution can be formed by a mixture of
normal distributions \citep[with the same mean and inverse-gamma-distributed
variances,][]{gelman2014}, we could observe heavy tails if we miss some
underlying mixture of intrinsic processes \citep{allen2001}. That process
might be an aggregation of populations across space, or population diversity,
or an intrinsic change in population variability through time. Extrinsic
forces could also cause black-swan dynamics \citep[e.g.][]{nunez2012}. These
forces could be extreme themselves. For example, extreme climate, predation
from (or competition with) other species experiencing black swans, or sharp
changes in human pressure such hunting, fishing, or habitat destruction might
cause black swans. Alternatively, the interaction of multiple ``normal''
extrinsic forces could give rise to black-swan ecological dynamics. This could
occur if the interaction is synergistic \citep[e.g.][]{kirby2009} or even if
non-synergistic interactions experience a rare alignment \citep{denny2009}.

There are a number of caveats when considering the generality of our results.
The GPDD data represent a taxonomically and geographically biased sample of
populations---the longer time series we focus on are dominated by commercially
and recreationally important species and a disproportionate number of
populations are located in the United Kingdom. Although we would expect to find
qualitatively similar evidence for black swans in many other large taxonomic or
geographic samples of populations, the common forces driving those black swans
would likely differ (e.g.~severe winters in Table~\ref{tab:sparks}). In
addition to a possibly biased sample of populations, some black-swan detections
could just be recording mistakes, or conversely, some extreme observations may
have been discarded or altered if they were erroneously suspected of being
recording mistakes. Indeed, three of the populations our method initially
identified as heavy tailed turned out to be data-entry errors and were
discarded (Supporting Information). A final caveat is that the temporal scales
of observation and population dynamics vary considerably across populations in
the GPDD and this likely influences the detection of heavy tails. As an
example, if we make frequent observations relative to generation time (e.g.~for
many large-bodied mammals) we will average across generations and perhaps miss
black swans. Conversely, if we census populations infrequently relative to
generation time (e.g.~many insects in the GPDD) the recorded data may average
across extreme and less-extreme events and also dampen black-swan dynamics.

Recognizing the prevalence of heavy-tailed dynamics suggests a number of
policy directions. Ecological resource management can draw from other
disciplines that focus on heavy tails. For example, earthquake preparedness
and response is focussed on black-swan events. Similarly to ecological black
swans, we can rarely predict the specific location and timing of large
earthquakes. But, earthquake preparedness involves spatial planning based on
forecast probabilities to focus early detection efforts and develop disaster
response plans. A similar focus might benefit resource management once our
ability to predict the spatial probability and covariates of ecological black
swans improves. The presence of black swans also suggests that we develop
management policy that is robust to heavy tails. For instance, setting target
population abundances that are appropriately set back from critical limits may
buffer black-swan events \citep[e.g.][]{caddy1996}, and maintaining genetic,
phenotypic, and behavioural diversity may allow some components of populations
to persist when others are affected by disease or extreme environmental forces
\citep[e.g.][]{hilborn2003, schindler2010, anderson2014}. Finally, extreme and
unexpected, surprising, or counterintuitive ecological dynamics offer a
tremendous opportunity to learn about ecological systems, evaluate when our
models break down, and adjust future management policy \citep{doak2008,
  pine-iii2009, lindenmayer2010}.

Our results suggest a number of research questions related to ecological black
swans. Given that black swans do occur, can we forecast the probability of
black swans in space and time? Furthermore, what management policies allow us
to detect them quickly after they happen? Can we isolate the components of
ecological dynamics that experience black swans by moving from
phenomenological models such as the Gompertz to mechanistic models that, for
example, take into account recruitment dynamics? We expect that greater
insight into the mechanisms and covariates of ecological black swans may be
best obtained through specific geographic and taxonomic subsets of data where
longer time series with low levels of observation error are available
\citep[e.g.][]{segura2013}.

Most importantly, what is the impact of allowing for black swans in forecasts
of ecological risk? In recent decades, ecology has moved toward focussing on
aspects of variance in addition to mean responses \citep[e.g.][]{loreau2010a,
  thompson2013}. Our results suggest that an added focus on ecological
extremes represents the next frontier, particularly in the face of increased
climate extremes \citep{meehl2004,thompson2013,ipcc2012}. Financial analysts
are concerned with the shape of the tails of financial returns because these
directly impact estimates of risk---the probability of a specific magnitude of
undesired event occurring \citep{rachev2008}. A comparable focus in ecology
would increase our estimates of extinction risk, since these would be
disproportionately impacted by downward black-swan events.
