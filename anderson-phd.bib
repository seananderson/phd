		  used as a null hypothesis to test the role of competition
		  and niche differences between species in community
		  stability. This hypothesis, however, is unrealistic because
		  it ignores the forces that contribute to synchronization of
		  population dynamics. Here we present a mechanistic neutral
		  model that describes the dynamics of a community of
		  equivalent species under the joint influence of density
		  dependence, environmental forcing, and demographic
		  stochasticity. We also introduce a new standardized measure
		  of species synchrony in multispecies communities. We show
		  that the per capita population growth rates of equivalent
		  species are strongly synchronized, especially when
		  endogenous population dynamics are cyclic or chaotic, while
		  their long‐term fluctuations in population sizes are
		  desynchronized by ecological drift. We then generalize our
		  model to nonneutral dynamics by incorporating temporal and
		  nontemporal forms of niche differentiation. Niche
		  differentiation consistently decreases the synchrony of
		  species per capita population growth rates, while its
		  effects on the synchrony of population sizes are more
		  complex. Comparing the observed synchrony of species per
		  capita population growth rates with that predicted by the
		  neutral model potentially provides a simple test of
		  deterministic asynchrony in a community.},

		  agricultural landscapes hinge on surviving biotic
		  assemblages. Maintaining crucial ecosystem processes and
		  services requires resilience to natural and anthropogenic
		  disturbances. However, the resilience and stability of
		  surviving biological communities remain poorly quantified.
		  From a 10-y dataset comprising 2,880 bird censuses across a
		  land-use gradient, we present three key findings concerning
		  the resilience and stability of Costa Rican bird
		  communities. First, seed dispersing, insect eating, and
		  pollinating guilds were more resilient to low-intensity
		  land use than high-intensity land use. Compared with forest
		  assemblages, bird abundance, species richness, and
		  diversity were all ∼15{\%} lower in low-intensity land
		  use and ∼50{\%} lower in high-intensity land use. Second,
		  patterns in species richness generally correlated with
		  patterns in stability: guilds exhibited less variation in
		  abundance in low-intensity land use than in high-intensity
		  land use. Finally, interspecific differences in reaction to
		  environmental change (response diversity) and possibly the
		  portfolio effect, but not negative covariance of species
		  abundances, conferred resilience and stability. These
		  findings point to the changes needed in agricultural
		  production practices in the tropics to better sustain bird
		  communities and, possibly, the functional and service roles

  abstract	= {Biodiversity may provide insurance against ecosystem
		  collapse by stabilizing assemblages that perform particular
		  ecological functions (the "portfolio effect"). However, the
		  extent to which this occurs in nature, and the importance
		  of different mechanisms that generate portfolio effects,
		  remains controversial. On coral reefs, herbivory helps
		  maintain coral dominated states, so volatility in levels of
		  herbivory has important implications for reef ecosystems.
		  Here we use an extensive time series of abundances on 35
		  reefs of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia to quantify
		  the strength of the portfolio effect for herbivorous
		  fishes. Then, we disentangle the contributions of two
		  mechanisms that underlie it: compensatory interactions, and
		  differential responses to environmental fluctuations
		  ("response diversity"), by fitting a community-dynamic
		  model than explicitly includes terms for both mechanisms.
		  We find that portfolio effects operate strongly in
		  herbivorous fishes, as shown by nearly independent
		  fluctuations in abundances over time. Moreover, we find
		  strong evidence for high response diversity, with nearly
		  independent responses to environmental fluctuations. In
		  contrast, we found little evidence that the portfolio
		  effect in this system was enhanced by compensatory
		  ecological interactions. Our results show that portfolio
		  effects are driven principally by response diversity for
		  herbivorous fishes on coral reefs. We conclude that
		  portfolio effects can be very strong in nature, and that,
		  for coral reefs in particular, response diversity on coral
		  reefs may help maintain herbivory above the threshold
		  levels that trigger regime shifts.},

		  variability that have confounded most, if not all, previous
		  studies of the subject. (2) The most commonly used measure
		  of variability, S.D.(log{$[$}N + 1{$]$}), is subject to
		  potentially very large bias, and other measures based on
		  untransformed densities can be affected by the long-tailed
		  frequency distributions of population data. (3) The fact
		  that variability often depends on the mean density is
		  usually ignored, yet it affects the generality of any
		  statement based on a single estimate of variation. (4) When
		  comparing variability between species, the generality of
		  any conclusions is also limited by the choice of spatial
		  and temporal scale of sampling. This potentially confounds
		  many studies. (5) We discuss the patterns that emerge from
		  considering spatial and temporal Taylor power plots, and
		  suggest that combinations of such plots for individual
		  species allow a classification according to markedly
		  different types of dynamics; the underlying mechanisms of
		  which are not well understood. (6) Finally, we consider

  abstract	= {The problems of the measurement of variation and the
		  selection of appropriate spatial and temporal units of
		  observation are discussed. Besides theoretical
		  considerations, the performance of variability measures in
		  data on annual catches of noctuid moths was assessed. Any
		  measure of variability is potentially biased by its
		  dependence on mean population size. The crucial role of
		  dependence of variance on the mean is indicated. Taylor's
		  power law is not a good model when the population mean is
		  low. The potential bias is large when the population mean
		  is small; in real data, the dependence of
		  SD{$[$}log(N+1){$]$}, CV and Lloyd's index was weak when
		  the mean annual catch was greater than 5 individuals.
		  Lloyd's index was the least dependent on the mean. There is
		  no single appropriate spatial or temporal scale for the
		  analysis of variability. Specific scales are appropriate to
		  specific questions. Multiple scale pattern analyses of time
		  series and transects or grids are informative.},

  abstract	= {(1) Ninety-seven species of aphids, 263 species of moths
		  and 111 species of birds were sampled simultaneously over
		  an area of about 2300 km2, for up to eleven, thirteen and
		  fifteen years at up to twenty-four, 126 and 210 sites,
		  respectively. (2) Aphid sites were uniform farmland; bird
		  sites were segregated into farmland and woodland; moth
		  sites were highly diverse. (3) Aphids were sampled by
		  suction traps, moths by light traps and birds by direct
		  observation. (4) By analogy with temporal variance, spatial
		  variance (Ss2) was used as a measure of spatial stability
		  and in most species was found to be proportional to a
		  fractional power of mean population density (ms). (5)
		  Estimates of the parameter b, in Ss2 = amsb, ranged from
		  1.29 to 2.95, 0.95 to 3.32 and 1.19 to 2.69 in aphids,
		  moths and birds respectively, and from 1.20 to 3.32 within
		  a single genus (Apamea). (6) Estimates of the parameter a
		  (in Ss2 = amsb) were different in farmland and woodland for
		  nearly half the bird species examined. This difference may
		  be due to environmental components of variance. (7)
		  Taylor's (1961) power model fitted well in 95{\%} of
		  species and, on logarithmic scales, mean population density
		  accounted for more than 70{\%} of the spatial variance in
		  more than 90{\%} of species. This suggests that species'
		  behaviour is a major component of spatial stability, being
		  the only common property in all the environmentally varied
		  samples. No species showed evidence of reaching an upper
		  limit of density constraining variance. (8) Only two
		  species had non-significant regressions and eighteen
		  (4{\%}) had significant curvature which may require further
		  investigation. The spatial distribution of one species was
		  not significantly different from random (S2 = m) at all
		  densities.},

  abstract	= {Theoretical and empirical studies have long suggested that
		  stability and complexity are intimately related, but
		  evidence from long-lived systems at large scales is
		  lacking. Stability can either be driven by complex species
		  interactions, or it can be driven by the presence/absence
		  and abundance of a species best able to perform a specific
		  ecosystem function. We use 64 years of stand productivity
		  measures in forest systems composed of four dominant
		  conifer tree species to contrast the effect of species
		  richness and abundance on three stability measures. To
		  perform this contrast, we measured the annual growth
		  increments of {$>$}900 trees in mixed and pure forest
		  stands to test three hypotheses: increased species richness
		  will (1) decrease stand variance, (2) increase stand
		  resistance to drought events, and (3) increase stand
		  resilience to drought events. In each case, the alternate
		  hypothesis was that species richness had no effect, but
		  that species composition and abundance within a stand drove
		  variance, resistance, and resilience. In pure stands, the
		  four species demonstrated significant differences in
		  productivity, and in their resistance and resilience to
		  drought events. The two pine species were the most drought
		  resistant and resilient, whereas mountain hemlock was the
		  least resistant and resilient, and red fir was
		  intermediate. For community measures we found a moderately
		  significant (P = 0.08) increase in the community
		  coefficient of variation and a significant (P = 0.03)
		  increase in resilience with increased species richness, but
		  no significant relationship between species richness and
		  community resistance, though the variance in community
		  resistance to drought decreased with species richness.
		  Community resistance to drought was significantly (P =
		  0.001) correlated to the relative abundance of lodgepole
		  pine, the most resistant species. We propose that
		  resistance is driven by competition for a single limiting
		  resource, with negative diversity effects. In contrast
		  resilience measures the capacity of communities to
		  partition resources in the absence of a single limiting
		  resource, demonstrating positive diversity effects.},

		  Connectivity effects on productivity, stability, and
		  persistence in a herring metapopulation model. -- ICES
		  Journal of Marine Science, 66: 000--000.Diverse and
		  interacting spawning groups of Atlantic herring (Clupea
		  harengus) have varying degrees of independence to
		  environmental conditions. How these population components
		  respond independently to the same set of environmental
		  conditions, and are connected through straying or
		  entrainment, will contribute to the aggregate
		  metapopulation dynamics. The consequences of connectivity
		  for productivity, stability, and persistence were evaluated
		  in an age-structured model of a two-component
		  metapopulation. Simulation scenarios of straying and
		  entrainment were developed to examine the effects of
		  component interchange and recruitment covariance on
		  metapopulation attributes. Asynchronous component responses
		  should result in reduced variance in metapopulation
		  dynamics, which was measured as the portfolio effect (PE).
		  Most types and magnitudes of connectivity reduced
		  metapopulation productivity and stability. Increased
		  connectivity tended to increase instability of a component
		  by distributing the effect of strong year classes among
		  components and disrupting the ``storage effect'' within
		  components. Density-dependent straying and entrainment,
		  respectively, showed stabilizing and destabilizing feedback
		  cycles on metapopulation stability and persistence.
		  Furthermore, high rates of connectivity tended to result in
		  increased synchronous responses between components and
		  depressed metapopulation productivity, stability, and PE.
		  Exploitation on a metapopulation should similarly depress
		  independence among components because high mortality will
		  dampen component responses to environmental forcing.},

  abstract	= {Recent research has highlighted the importance of
		  interpopulation diversity in fostering the stability of
		  population complexes. Here we focus on California's
		  recently collapsed fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
		  tshawytscha) and ask whether portfolio effect induced
		  buffering is observed across the complexity hierarchy from
		  individual populations to popu- lations within a river
		  basin (Sacramento, San Joaquin) to the entire Central
		  Valley. Some buffering was observed when com- paring the
		  coefficient of variation in adult returns to a given river
		  basin with its constituent populations but not when
		  comparing returns to the entire Central Valley with its
		  constituent basins because of disproportionately many fish
		  returning to the Sacramento Basin. Moreover, we report that
		  positive correlations in population dynamics between rivers
		  were stronger in the last 25 years of the study compared
		  with the first 25 years. Together, these results suggest
		  evidence of only a weak portfolio effect that has
		  deteriorated in recent years. Nonetheless, we also report
		  that correlations between rivers decreased significantly
		  with distance, suggesting that some biocomplexity remains.
		  Our results suggest that the greatest potential for
		  strengthening the portfolio effect would come through
		  restoration of San Joaquin Basin populations, which at low
		  abundance currently contribute little to the overall
		  buffering capacity despite low cross-basin correlations.},

  abstract	= {A striking and consistent observation in ecology is that
		  variability in population abundance of a species and
		  average population density are related in both space and
		  time1,2. Taylor and his colleagues have shown that this
		  relationship between variance (V) and mean (M) conforms
		  well to a simple power law for a very wide range of animal
		  and plant species, with the logarithms of sample variance
		  and average sample density following a linear
		  relationship1−3 (V = {\^a}M where {\^a} and are
		  constants). They suggest that the slope of this line, ,
		  which generally falls within the range 1 to 2, is a
		  species-specific characteristic reflecting the balance
		  between the opposing behavioural tendencies to aggregate
		  within, and migrate from, centres of population density4.
		  Taylor and co-workers1−6 have stressed that migration
		  between patches is rarely a random process, on the evidence
		  of the observed 'density-dependent' relationships between
		  the degree of dispersion (the variance to mean ratio, V/M
		  and mean abundance per patch). We show here that the
		  relationship between variability and average abundance can
		  be a simple, and inevitable, consequence of chance
		  demographic events in the dynamics of population growth and
		  decline. The precise form of these relationships is
		  determined by the relative magnitude of the various rate
		  processes which govern the dynamics of population change
		  (the birth, death, immigration and emigration rates), and
		  by the degree of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We do
		  not need to invoke any complex behavioural mechanisms to
		  explain observed patterns.},

@Article{	  taylor1982,
  abstract	= {(1) In an initial analysis, the inter- and intra-specific
		  relationships between spatial and temporal variances and
		  means are examined comparatively within and between
		  ninety-seven aphid, 263 month and eighty-four bird species
		  at up to 300 sites for about a decade throughout Great
		  Britain. (2) Despite the vast amount of data available,
		  from which more than half the species sampled had been
		  removed before analysis because they were numerically
		  inadequate, parameter bias remains in some species and
		  results in interspecific artifacts. (3) Population
		  parameters dependent on small samples with arithmetic means
		  below two and variances below four, are subject to
		  distortion affecting all measures of aggregation. The
		  artifact of small discrete samples is illustrated by
		  spurious patterns in the relationship between log mean and
		  log variance. (4) In contrast, taxonomic defects in the
		  data were discovered by inconsistencies in the analysis of
		  spatio-temporal pattern because of the large numbers of
		  species sampled simultaneously. (5) The power function is
		  here fitted as a functional linear regression in logs to
		  provide an economical working model for the interdependence
		  between variance and mean density. (6) In multispecies
		  samples, the power relating mean and variance approaches
		  two in temporal regressions for aphids and moths and in
		  spatial regressions for aphids, as expected from
		  conventional theory, but not for moths in space or birds in
		  either space or time. (7) For separate species, the powers
		  range from 0.8 to 2.8 in time and 1.3 to 3.8 in space; mean
		  values for aphids, moths and birds are 1.99/2.14, 1.55/2.24
		  and 1.30/1.79, respectively, in time/space. (8) There is no
		  interspecific correlation between the spatial and temporal
		  powers relating variance and mean density. (9) The
		  interspecific spatial power is probably independent of
		  differences in population density between species. The
		  temporal power increases with mean population density
		  between species and this accounts for about 30{\%} of the
		  interspecific variance. (10) There is further evidence that
		  environment and sample size affect the factor, a, rather
		  than the power, b, in both space and time. (11) The bird
		  data show this in the disrupting effect, on some species'
		  population structures, of the constraints imposed on
		  environmental pattern by man. (12) The interspecific
		  relationship between the factor, a, and the power, b, has
		  common elements in all taxa and both space and time, but
		  scales differ; the pattern is complex and not yet fully
		  understood. (13) Only by using samples from such large
		  homogeneous groups of species sampled simultaneously could
		  any confidence be placed in these results. In particular,
		  the data from the two groups of moths were much the most
		  consistent despite the defects of attraction sampling. (14)
		  The analysis suggests that some of the evidence presented
		  for dynamic theory is suspect because its species' base is
		  narrow and its replication inadequate.},

		  link between plant species diversity and biomass production
		  or yield. These data suggest that increased plant species
		  diversity has considerable insurance potential by providing
		  higher levels of risk-adjusted yield of biomass. We close
		  by discussing how to develop conservation strategies that
		  actively manage biodiversity portfolios in ways that
		  address performance risk, and suggest a new empirical

  abstract	= {In this article, we explain an often overlooked process
		  that may significantly contribute to positive correlations
		  between measures of species diversity and community
		  stability. Empirical studies showing positive
		  stability-diversity relationships have, for the most part,
		  used a single class of stability (or, more accurately,
		  instability) measures: the temporal variation in aggregate
		  community properties such as biomass or productivity. We
		  show that for these measures, stability will essentially
		  always rise with species diversity because of the
		  statistical averaging of the fluctuations in species'
		  abundances. This simple probabilistic process will operate
		  in the absence of any strong species interactions, although
		  its strength is driven by the relative abundances of
		  species, as well as by the existence of positive or
		  negative correlations in the fluctuations of species. To
		  explore the possible importance of this effect in real
		  communities, we fit a simple simulation model to Tilman's
		  grassland community. Our results indicate that statistical
		  averaging might play a substantial role in explaining
		  stability-diversity correlations for this and other systems
		  Models of statistical averaging can serve as a useful
		  baseline for predictions of community stability, to which
		  the influences of both negative and positive species
		  interactions may then be added and tested.},

  abstract	= {Genes, species and ecosystems are often considered to be
		  assets. The need to ensure a sufficient diversity of this
		  asset is being increasingly recognised today. Asset
		  managers in banks and insurance companies face a similar
		  challenge. They are asked to manage the assets of their
		  investors by constructing efficient portfolios. They
		  deliberately make use of a phenomenon observed in the
		  formation of portfolios: returns are additive, while risks
		  diversify. This phenomenon and its implications are at the
		  heart of portfolio theory. Portfolio theory, like few other
		  economic theories, has dramatically transformed the
		  practical work of banks and insurance companies. Before
		  portfolio theory was developed about 50 years ago, asset
		  managers were confronted with a situation similar to the
		  situation the research on biodiversity faces today. While
		  the need for diversification was generally accepted, a
		  concept that linked risk and return on a portfolio level
		  and showed the value of diversification was missing.
		  Portfolio theory has closed this gap. This article first
		  explains the fundamentals of portfolio theory and transfers
		  it to biodiversity. A large part of this article is then
		  dedicated to some of the implications portfolio theory has
		  for the valuation and management of biodiversity. The last

@Article{	  schindler2010,
  abstract	= {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that
		  biological diver- sity stabilizes ecosystem processes and
		  the services they provide to society1--4, a concept that
		  has become a common argument for bio- diversity
		  conservation5. Species-rich communities are thought to
		  produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because
		  of the complementary or independent dynamics among species
		  that per- form similar ecosystem functions6. Such variance
		  dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio
		  effect7 and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity
		  on the stability of financial portfolios8. In ecology,
		  these arguments have focused on the effects of species
		  diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered
		  the impor- tance of biologically relevant diversity within
		  individual species9. Current rates of population
		  extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude
		  higher than species extinction rates10, so there is a
		  pressing need to clarify how population and life history
		  diversity affect the performance of individual species in
		  providing impor- tant ecosystem services. Here we use five
		  decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in
		  Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of
		  portfolio effects that derive from population and life
		  history diversity in an important and heavily exploited
		  species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns
		  is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted
		  of a single homogenous population rather than the several
		  hundred discrete populations it currently consists of.
		  Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population,
		  such increased variability would lead to ten times more
		  frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also
		  evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and
		  extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results
		  demon- strate the critical importance of maintaining
		  population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and
		  securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them.
		  The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster
		  than indicated by species loss alone.},

@Article{	  tilman1999,
  abstract	= {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the
		  effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and
		  susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition
		  predicts that increases in diversity cause community
		  stability to increase, but population stability to
		  decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent,
		  explained by how temporal variances in species abundances
		  scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact
		  of this scaling on population vs. community stability.
		  Community stability also depends on a negative covariance
		  effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding
		  (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A
		  long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these
		  predictions. Models of competition predict, and field
		  experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to
		  greater primary productivity. This diversity-productivity
		  relationship results both from the greater chance that a
		  more productive species would be present at higher
		  diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better
		  'coverage' of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader
		  range of species traits in a more diverse community (the
		  niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more
		  complete utilization of limiting resources at higher
		  diversity, which increases resource retention, further
		  increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available
		  limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to
		  decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion,
		  supporting the diversity-invasibility hypothesis. This
		  mechanism provides rules for community assembly and
		  invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added
		  to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and
		  climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem
		  dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great
		  directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are
		  likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning
		  of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these
		  ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide
		  society with the knowledge essential for wise management of
		  the earth and its biological resources.},
