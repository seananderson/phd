Strengths of portfolio perspective: units theories emphasizes variance conveys
diversification and risk

What I showed:
mean-variance problem with portfolio effects and a new way of measuring stability in metapopulations

ability of response diversity to create stable and productive metapopulation portfolios... how efficient frontiers can illustrate inherent tradeoffs in management or conservation decisions (decreasing habitat scenario of metafolio)

Challenges and opportunities of applying portfolio theory to population dynamics... summarize these

How we can measure synchrony in a Bayesian context... powerful tool to separating synchrony and variability components in communities and metapopulations

Ways forward:

Black swans

synchrony modelling

applying population dynamics portfolio optimization

experimental work exploring the portfolio effect and portfolio management

role of response diversity in stabilizing populations, metapopulations, and communities
