# Introduction

In the coming century we face a loss of biodiversity on the order of
100--10,000 times greater than average rates in the fossil record [@mea2005]
--- a rate as fast if not faster than any of the five past mass extinctions
[@barnosky2011; @harnik2012]. Compounding this problem for conservation
managers is uncertainty in future climate conditions [@heller2009] and the
unknown responses of species and communities to those conditions
[@lavergne2010]. Therefore, urgent questions are: Exactly how big a problem is
the loss of biodiversity for the stability of ecological systems? How can
conservation biologists communicate the insurance benefit of biodiversity to
the public and policy makers? And, how can we apply limited conservation funds
to manage biodiversity and limit risk in the face of increasing environmental
uncertainty?

Nearly a decade ago, @figge2004 and @koellner2006 laid the foundation for why
financial portfolio theory is ideally suited for answering these questions.
Financial portfolio theory seems applicable to ecological systems for at least
four reasons. First, ecological and financial systems are both structured
hierarchically. Groups of populations form metapopulations and groups of
species form communities; groups of financial assets form investment funds,
which in turn form portfolios. Additionally, ecological and financial managers
have similar goals. Ecological resource managers might wish to minimize the
probability of population decline while maintaining an acceptable level of
hunting of fishing; financial portfolio managers minimize the probability of
large economic losses for an acceptable level of expected financial returns
[@may2008]. Another reason why portfolio theory is ideally suited for ecology
is that substantial resources have gone into developing mathematical theory for
optimizing financial investments. There is therefore a rich body of theory and
experience to draw from. Finally, the portfolio metaphor is an engaging and
accessible way for ecologists and conservationists to think about ecological
variance and biological diversity and convey the importance of this (often
abstract) literature.

A number of recent studies have used financial portfolios as a metaphor,
metric, or management approach (Fig.Â \ref{fig:traits}) to estimate and
communicate the stabilizing benefit of diversity and prioritize its
conservation [e.g. @schindler2010; @ando2011; @halpern2011; @hoekstra2012;
@anderson2013; @mellin2014]. For example, @moore2010 used the portfolio
metaphor to show how increased synchrony of salmon populations could lead to
heightened extinction risk. @thibaut2012 used the portfolio-effect metric to
quantify the insurance benefit of diversity for reef fish communities.
@ando2012 used portfolio optimization to prioritize habitat for conservation
that would create wetlands most robust to climate-change uncertainty. Portfolio
theory promises to move conservation biology beyond the familiar concepts of
the quantity, variety, and distribution of species [@mace2005] and into a new
dimension that emphasizes elements of variance, covariance, stability,
synchrony, and extremeness [@loreau2010a; @thompson2013].

But in applying financial theory to conservation biology, where does the
portfolio metaphor break down? What exactly are the assets, portfolios, and
investors in the financial metaphor? Furthermore, how might one invest in
different kinds of ecological portfolios? And how might the differences between
financial and ecological data affect our ability to apply financial portfolio
theory to conservation biology? Are ecological portfolios just another name for
existing ecological theory? Or, can ecological portfolios bring together and
provide new insights into a wide variety of ecological theory?

Here, we address these questions by reviewing the emerging literature on
ecological portfolios. The purpose of our review is fourfold: review the three
recent contrasting applications of ecological portfolios as metaphors, metrics,
and management tools; illustrate how ecological portfolios can bring together a
wide variety of modern ecological theory; highlight some challenges of applying
financial theory to ecological portfolios; and emphasize the utility of
portfolio optimization and risk metrics for conservation prioritization.
