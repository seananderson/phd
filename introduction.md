\chapter[Introduction]{Introduction}

In the coming century we face a loss of biodiversity on the order of
100--10,000 times greater than average rates in the fossil record [@mea2005]
--- a rate as fast if not faster than any of the five past mass extinctions
[@barnosky2011; @harnik2012]. Compounding this problem for conservation
managers is uncertainty in future climate conditions [@heller2009] and the
unknown responses of species and communities to those conditions
[@lavergne2010]. Therefore, urgent questions are: Exactly how big a problem is
the loss of biodiversity for the stability of ecological systems? How can
conservation biologists communicate the insurance benefit of biodiversity to
the public and policy makers? And, how can we apply limited conservation funds
to manage biodiversity and limit risk in the face of increasing environmental
uncertainty?

Nearly a decade ago, @figge2004 and @koellner2006 laid the foundation for why
financial portfolio theory is ideally suited for answering these questions.
Financial portfolio theory seems applicable to ecological systems for at least
four reasons. First, ecological and financial systems are both structured
hierarchically. Groups of populations form metapopulations and groups of
species form communities; groups of financial assets form investment funds,
which in turn form portfolios. Additionally, ecological and financial managers
have similar goals. Ecological resource managers might wish to minimize the
probability of population decline while maintaining an acceptable level of
hunting of fishing; financial portfolio managers minimize the probability of
large economic losses for an acceptable level of expected financial returns
[@may2008]. Another reason why portfolio theory is ideally suited for ecology
is that substantial resources have gone into developing mathematical theory for
optimizing financial investments. There is therefore a rich body of theory and
experience to draw from. Finally, the portfolio metaphor is an engaging and
accessible way for ecologists and conservationists to think about ecological
variance and biological diversity and convey the importance of this (often
abstract) literature.

A number of recent studies have used financial portfolios as a metaphor,
metric, or management approach (Fig. \ref{fig:traits}) to estimate and
communicate the stabilizing benefit of diversity and prioritize its
conservation [e.g. @schindler2010; @ando2011; @halpern2011; @hoekstra2012;
@anderson2013; @mellin2014]. For example, @moore2010 used the portfolio
metaphor to show how increased synchrony of salmon populations could lead to
heightened extinction risk. @thibaut2012 used the portfolio-effect metric to
quantify the insurance benefit of diversity for reef fish communities.
@ando2012 used portfolio optimization to prioritize habitat for conservation
that would create wetlands most robust to climate-change uncertainty. Portfolio
theory promises to move conservation biology beyond the familiar concepts of
the quantity, variety, and distribution of species [@mace2005] and into a new
dimension that emphasizes elements of variance, covariance, stability,
synchrony, and extremeness [@loreau2010a; @thompson2013].

But in applying financial theory to conservation biology, where does the
portfolio metaphor break down? What exactly are the assets, portfolios, and
investors in the financial metaphor? Furthermore, how might one invest in
different kinds of ecological portfolios? And how might the differences between
financial and ecological data affect our ability to apply financial portfolio
theory to conservation biology? Are ecological portfolios just another name for
existing ecological theory? Or, can ecological portfolios bring together and
provide new insights into a wide variety of ecological theory?

TODO EDIT THIS!!! Here, we address these questions by reviewing the emerging
literature on ecological portfolios. The purpose of our review is fourfold:
review the three recent contrasting applications of ecological portfolios as
metaphors, metrics, and management tools; illustrate how ecological portfolios
can bring together a wide variety of modern ecological theory; highlight some
challenges of applying financial theory to ecological portfolios; and emphasize
the utility of portfolio optimization and risk metrics for conservation
prioritization.

# Ecological portfolios as a metaphor

Metaphors are powerful tools for communicating and shaping scientific ideas
[@brown2003] and are particularly useful in developing and communicating the
field of conservation biology [@larson2011]. In conservation biology, the
portfolio concept has long been used as a metaphor to emphasize the need to not
put all your eggs in one basket. This metaphor has come into particular
prominence in the last decade. For example, the IUCN Criterion B2a recognizes
the risks associated with a species existing in few locations [@iucn2001]. As
another example, ecologists have suggested the need to bet hedge by developping
a portfolio of approaches when tackling conservation issues [e.g.
@ehrlich2008]. Ecologists have also used the metaphor to refer to diverse
ecosystems and communities as portfolios of species [@figge2004]. These
applications are an appealing way to convey concepts of diversification,
uncertainty, and risk using familiar terminology. 
<!--On the surface the metaphor seems intuitive; however, recent studies have-->
<!--pressed the metaphor further as both a metric and management tool [e.g.-->
<!--@moore2010; @schindler2010; @halpern2011; @ando2012; @anderson2014] and the-->
<!--question remains how far we can take the metaphor before it breaks down-->
<!--[@anderson2013].-->

# The portfolio-effect metric

Beyond the metaphor, the portfolio-effect metric asks what the precise benefit
is of a unit increase in diversity. The portfolio effect is derived from the
economic question: How much better off are you by investing your money in a
diversified portfolio instead of investing all your money in a single asset
[@markowitz1952]? In conservation biology, we can consider the current
ecological system the diversified portfolio and a theoretical homogeneous (or
monoculture) system the single asset [@anderson2013]. For example, we could ask
how much more stable is a metapopulation of salmon from different streams,
rivers, or watersheds (the portfolio) compared to a theoretical homogeneous
stream population (the single asset) [@schindler2010; @carlson2011]. Hence, to
accurately measure a portfolio effect we need to predict the variability of a
theoretical homogeneous system---a system that lacks the element of
biodiversity we are interested in. Unfortunately, although the portfolio
metaphor provides a new way of looking at the decades-old diversity-stability
debate, on its own it remains unclear whether it provides new insights about
the nature of the relationship itself.

Nonetheless, by providing a new lens, the portfolio effect as a metric has
created an impetus for new theoretical and empirical insights into
stability-diversity relationships. Early work focused on theoretical aspects of
the portfolio effect for greatly simplified systems---identifying when we
would expect a stabilizing portfolio effect and what factors would enhance it
[@doak1998; @tilman1998; @lehman2000]. Over time, theoretical studies developed
indices that relaxed assumptions about the systems they describe [e.g.
@loreau2010a; @thibaut2013; @gross2013]. A recent trend has been to apply these
indices to empirical data, albeit primarily to salmon [@greene2010;
@schindler2010; @carlson2011; @anderson2013; @mellin2014]. However, empirical
work has concentrated on applying relatively simple portfolio-effect metrics
that make strong assumptions that are rarely met in empirical systems
[@thibaut2013; @anderson2013]. Violation of these assumptions, for example, the
assumption that the temporal standard deviation scales directly with the mean,
or that populations are approximately equal in size, can distort our perception
of the portfolio effect and hence the perceived benefit of diversity to
ecological stability [@anderson2013].

<!--TODO Bring in the @gross2013 paper and metric and give more details on
    @thibaut2013 - give examples-->

# Ecological portfolio management

In addition to measuring the portfolio-effect metric, we can use financial
portfolio theory to inform decisions about conservation management. Markowitz's
seminal contribution to financial portfolio theory was a focus on portfolio
selection---the idea that out of all possible portfolios there exists a subset
that maximize returns for a level of risk (or minimize risk for a level
of return) [@markowitz1952] (Fig. \ref{fig:mpt}). In conservation biology, the
goals of conservation practitioners often parallel those of financial managers,
even though they are rarely expressed as such [@figge2004]. We see ecological
portfolio management happening in one of three ways: choosing existing
management structures that promote diversified portfolios, using Modern
Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimize ecological resource extraction, or using MPT
to optimize an ecological system itself.

An introduction to Modern Portfolio Theory mean-variance optimization. In
finance, portfolios are formed by choosing how much to invest in various
assets. Modern Portfolio Theory focuses on identifying the set of portfolios
that optimizes the trade-off between expected return (mean) and expected
variance or risk. (a) This set of portfolios is referred to as the efficient
frontier. (b) The minimum variance portfolio achieves the lowest expected
risk; the remaining risk is said to be undiversifiable. (c) A risker, but
still efficient portfolio. (d) An example inefficient portfolio, which has a
lower expected return than (c) and greater expected risk than (b). Adapted

First, we can consider existing management structures that create systems
analogous to diversified portfolios. For example, fishers can engage in
catch-pooling cooperatives where fishers share the profits from their catches
according to predefined rules. @sethi2012 showed that this portfolio-like
scheme reduces risk for red king crab fishers in the Bering Sea by up to 40%.
Other fisheries management tools, such as community-based management,
individual transferable quotas (ITQs), and licensing systems that allow for
fishing a diversity of species, can create diversified catch portfolios for
fishers and buffer fishers against the risk of poor profits [@hilborn2001;
@kasperski2013]. Alternatively, we can consider the properties of a diversified
portfolio, such as representation, resilience, and redundancy, and look for
management strategies that promote these properties in ecological systems
[@haak2012]

We can also use MPT directly to optimally allocate harvesting efforts. This
suggestion is not new---some of the earliest references to ecological
portfolios suggest portfolio theory as a management tool [@baldursson1997;
@costanza2000] but few studies have explored the idea to its full extent and
interest in the topic has expanded strongly in recent years [e.g. @edwards2004;
@sanchirico2008; @halpern2011; @moloney2011]. In conservation biology,
portfolio optimization can be applied spatially. For example, @halpern2011 used
MPT to illustrate the tradeoff between fishing profits and spatial unevenness
of marine resource value. MPT has also been used to optimize decisions about
whether to clearcut or retain standing trees [@hyytiainen2008;
@hildebrandt2011]. As a third example, @moloney2011 used MPT to optimize the
choice of grazing animals on Australia's rangelands. With few exceptions,
however, the application of MPT for harvesting decisions has been limited to
fishery and forestry examples.

Finally, we can use ecological portfolio management to choose how we allocate
conservation efforts to manage risk for an ecological system as a whole. For
example, portfolio optimization can be used to spatially allocate conservation
activity for wetlands to maximize ecosystem services at a given level of risk
under the uncertainty of climate change [@ando2011; @ando2012]. In forestry,
MPT has been used to select the optimal weighting of seed sources for
regenerating forests under a variety of climate change scenarios [@crowe2008].
In fisheries, MPT has been used to assess the risk-return trade-off for salmon
metapopulation productivity given choices about what habitat to conserve under
climate change and stream-flow reduction scenarios [@anderson2014]. We see this
as a promising but largely unexplored use of ecological portfolio theory.
